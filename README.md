# betajs-scoped 0.0.1

Scoped is a small module for scoped loading of modules and dependencies. It is very similar to RequireJS.

It allows you to load javascript modules and resolve dependencies. One of the main differences to RequireJS is that you can also define global namespaces that external programs can use.
